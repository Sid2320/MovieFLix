# MovieFlix
It is an Movie recommendation System which works on content base filtering with sentimental analysis of the reviews, recommends movies similar to the movies the user likes and analyses the sentiments on the reviews given by the user for that movie.

This application provides all the details of the requested movie such as overview, genre, release date, rating, runtime, top cast, reviews, recommended movies, etc.

All the details of the movies such as Titles, genre, runtime, rating, poster, etc are fetched using an API by **TMDB**.

The reviews given by the user is brought from IMDB by web scraping the IMDB site and sentiment analysis is performed on those reviews.
